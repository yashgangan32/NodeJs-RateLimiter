This project is a Node.js API that manages user tasks with rate limiting and queuing using Redis. It ensures users can only perform 1 task per second and 20 tasks per minute, queuing any excess tasks. Redis is used for efficient rate limiting and task management. To run the project, install dependencies with npm install, configure the .env file, start Redis server, and launch the server with npm start.
